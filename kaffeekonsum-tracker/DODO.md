# To-do List

- [ ] Set the current date as the default for new entries for the date selector of new entries.
    Save the current date, and time (minutes and seconds)
- [ ] Save entries with hours and minutes for clearer overview.
    for new entries save the hours and minutes too. before making changes to the code, fetch the backend to see if changes needed to be made there. i've installed the appwrite-cli on my system, why not use that.

## Fix Variants Stuff
- [ ] Deleted user in backend, ensure they can login again and access the dashboard page.
    Currently if they try to login after the user was deleted in the backend, it would redirect you to the base page, even if accessing /dashboard directy -> instant redirect to homepage
