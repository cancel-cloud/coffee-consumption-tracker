# Documentation Directory

This directory is reserved for future feature documentation and developer guides.

## Structure

When documenting new features, organize them as follows:

```
docs/
├── features/           # Feature-specific documentation
├── api/               # API documentation (if applicable)
├── deployment/        # Deployment guides
└── troubleshooting/   # Common issues and solutions
```

## Guidelines

- Use Markdown format for all documentation
- Include code examples where relevant
- Update the main README.md for major changes
- Reference COPILOT_REFERENCE.md for development context
